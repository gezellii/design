# Me Page Revamp

<p class="time">@Shopee, 2023</p>

<span class="intro">
<span class="bg">

## Background

Me Page is frequently used by 78.9% of active buyers, drawing ~8M views per month, acting as one of the key tabs distributing traffic to Shopee features.

However, the page has become bloated and inefficient due to the growing number of product entrances introduced on the page.

In project, we plan to review and optimise the overall user experience, and uplift the order contribution at the same time.

1. ## Define Problem

### 1.1  Understand user behaviours:

1. With avaiable **data** we learnt:
   - 85.4% Me Page users are buyers who have made a purchase before. Highly possible that the main scenario brought them to Me Page is to **check order status** after placing orders.
   - Task Driven - **Tools** (e.g. order/account management) account for > 70% of all clicks on Me Page which set the foundation of Me Page positioning.
   - Promotion sections (e.g. Buy Again and Campaign circles) account for < 2% of clicks, but draw 30>% complains about Me page.
   - Single Page Preference - With only 22.3% users **scrolling down**, most features from 2nd and 3rd page are not exposed.

2. We also **ranked the click** of different functions to know customers’ perference upon our services.

3. To **measure the experience**, we designed several **usibility tests** and tested with random customers in different regions,hoping to accumulate basic experience metrics such as **task complete rate, time on task and SCAT**:
   - Check order status;
   - Update my address;
   - Buy one item that you liked before;
   - Raise return/refund for an order;
   - Contact Shopee customer service;

With thoes **business & experience metrics**, we not only got a clear understanding of the status quo, but also laid the foundation for measuring the results of our following optimization.

### 1.2 Summarise pain points:

#### From user’s point of view:

- Inefficient space allocation caused difficulties in finding desired features
- No length control resulted in a lengthy page while most users do not scroll down
- The mixed content and the similar appearance make the content look confusing and difficult to distinguish.
- Unwanted promotion sections

#### From business‘ point of view:

- Raise tools efficiency
- Unleash the potential of huge traffic to boost sales as well as promote other features
- Scalable for different regions
2. ## Design Goals and Principles:

1. Me Page continues to fulfil its task-oriented core function
2. User traffic on Me Page can be harnessed effectively for promotion campaigns

**Principle**:

- Efficient: New design must raise the efficiency of core tasks
- Concise: Shorten page length to < 1.5 screen
- Consisten: Maintain a scalable layout and color coding based on Shopee Design System
3. ## Information Architecture:

With all the research result, we started from sorting out elements by groups.

This step required a lot of communication with higher manager as well as different stakeholders(Me page PMs, all feature PMs, country PMs).The challenge is，we not only need to convince the boss of the rationality of our product positioning and structure, but also convince every PIC in charge of the relevant content on this page to adjust or even give up their position on Me page. 
The specific feature of each country is different, and the priority of each module is also different. 
We need to meet the needs of each market on the basis of overall optimization, and let them finally reach an agreement.

4. ## Visual Language:

After the information hierarchy and grouping are confirmed, we moved into the high-fidelity prototype to discuss the final visual representation.

The core of our discussion is that，apply appropriate visual language to distinguish elements with different natures（functiona vs. promotion） as well as different priorities, so as to make the whole page functionally intuitive and aesthetically appealing.

We explored possible design directions of each module and talked about the different visual effects brought about by different combinations, their impact on user concerns, and how it will ultimately affect user behavior.
