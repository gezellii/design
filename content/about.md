Hi~

My Chinese name is 李露 /li:lu:/, my friends call me Nino :)

I've been working in the e-commerce industry as a product designer for over 7 years, serving customers in Mainland China, Russia, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.​​

My current role is Expert Designer at Shopee, in charge of several small design teams under different product lines.

My daily jobs are ​

- Leverage insights from data and user feedback to design tailored experiences that achieve desired outcome;
- Manage and prioritize design works for team members and review design outputs;
- Mentoring junior designers.

When I'm not working, I help with some open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/lilylee1874).
